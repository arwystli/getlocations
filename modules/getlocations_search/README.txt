Getlocations Search provides a search facility that will show nearby
locations from Getlocation Fields enabled nodes, users, terms or comments.

It also has support for Geofield and Geolocation

It can however be used without any of the above modules enabled, in which case
it will just do searches and show a map of the area found.

Enable Getlocations Search under Modules, then go to
Configuration > Web Services > Getlocations Search and set it up to suit your needs,
then go to Structure > Menus > Navigation where you can enable the link.
